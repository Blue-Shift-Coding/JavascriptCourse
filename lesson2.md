#Javascript - Lesson 2: Strings & Numbers


##Getting started

Go to http://editor.blueshiftcoding.com.

At the top of the screen, make sure that JavaScript and Output are selected.  You should also un-select HTML, Console, and CSS.

Click ‘Set Template’ and choose ‘Lesson 2 - strings and numbers’.

##Fancy text

- Can you change the number of lines?
- Can you make all the lines the same colour?
- Can you put all the words on the same line? (hint - try “turning off” one or more lines of code, by turning them into a -comment by putting // at the start)

##Variables, strings, and numbers

In Javascript, if we want to store some data to use later in the program, we can put it in something called a variable.  We can always do this using the keyword var and an equals sign (=).  For example:

```ch
var message = "Javascript is awesome";
var a = 0;
```
